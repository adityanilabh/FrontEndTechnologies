/*
 all the data is stored inside the computer in the form of binary 
 numbers 0 and 1. Since computers can only understand and process data in the 
 form of 0’s and 1’s.

 only a Number as a primitive data type but the numbers are of the form Integer and 
 float. So these types come under the Number data type and are internally stored 
 according to their different formats depending upon the type of operation being 
 performed on them.

/*
let a = 4
let b = 78

a will be stored in the memory with the value of:- 100
b will be stored in the memory with the value of:- 1001110

similarly for negative and positive: 

let a = 6
let b = -6

a will be stored in memory with the value of :- 000110
b will be stored in memory with the value of :- 100110

but if we try to add these numbers, answer will be 44 and not 0,


A further improvement of this method was implemented and one’s complement representation was used to store the number

One’s complement of a number is toggling all the 0’s into 1 and 1’s to 0. 
Suppose there is a binary number 11001001, then its one’s complement will be 00110110.


When storing Integers in unsigned bit simple binary format is followed 

In order to store signed bit integers, the numbers internally will be stored
 as two’s complement so as to increase the storage capacity and improve arithmetic 
 calculation.
