/* 
What is JSON?
-- JSON stands for Javascript Object Notification.
What is it used for?
Like XML, it is one of the ways of formatting the data. Such a format of data is 
used by web applications to communicate with each other.

Why JSON? 
The fact that whenever we declare a variable and assign a value to it, itâ€™s not the 
variable that holds the value but rather the variable just holds an address in the 
memory where the initialized value is stored

Characteristics of JSON
It is Human-readable and writable.
It is a lightweight text-based data interchange format which means, 
it is simpler to read and write when compared to XML.
It is widely used as a data storage and communication format on the web.
Though it is derived from a subset of JavaScript, it is Language-independent. 
Thus, the code for generating and parsing JSON data can be written in any other 
programming language.

//Convert a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object

let text = '{"model":[' +
	'{"carName":"Baleno","brandName":"Maruti" },' +
	'{"carName":"Aura","brandName":"Hyndai" },' +
	'{"carName":"Nexon","brandName":"Tata" }]}';

const cars = JSON.parse(text);
console.log("The car name is: " + cars.model[2].carName + 
	" of brand: " + cars.model[2].brandName);
