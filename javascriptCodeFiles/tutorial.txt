1. to change the content: always use onclick="<function_name>";
2. remember that element inside tag are string. so suppose you want to change the value of 
string ( that represent a number), always use parseInt(document.getelementbyId(...).innerHTML);


3. also, int is changed to string with .toString(), and it's important to convert things to string to be
used in html code.
